# Wordle_clone
Clone of Wordle game based on tutorial from Web Dev Simplified
This program generates a game similar to the popular game Wordle using 1 html file, 1 css file, and 1 javascript file. Game can be played in a browser such as Firefox by having these 3 files in the same folder location and opening the index.html file. The object of the game is to guess the 5-letter word of the day in 6 guesses or fewer. ![image](https://github.com/Johnsonisaacn/Wordle_clone/assets/114550967/d50a31fb-998b-4362-b395-922606e957d4)

 The user can enter and edit letters to guess the word using their keyboard or the on-screen keyboard. They can also enter their guess using their keyboard or the on-screen version. Letters used in guesses that don't appear in the word of the day will become darkened on the on-screen keyboard, while letters that are in the word of the day but not in the correct place will become yellow in the keyboard and guess grid. ![image](https://github.com/Johnsonisaacn/Wordle_clone/assets/114550967/b991b14a-c585-4801-82a5-9c090fec50bd)

When the user guesses a correct letter in the correct location, that letter will become green on the keyboard and guess grid. ![image](https://github.com/Johnsonisaacn/Wordle_clone/assets/114550967/756a389b-1910-4a04-997f-30789f719d81)

If the user guesses the correct word within 6 guesses, all 5 letters of the word will appear green and dance! ![image](https://github.com/Johnsonisaacn/Wordle_clone/assets/114550967/e8c89eda-71e3-4b02-ad5d-1f41055428f7)
